# pyDeltaSigmaAnneal
An ongoing project to run a simulated anneal for the best filter possible for a 1-bit audio encoder using noise shaping.

This is an ongoing project to implement a Python extension module for a 1-bit audio encoder, then subsequently use it to determine the optimal filter coefficients for noise shaping based directly on the noise floor on an actual encoded signal.
